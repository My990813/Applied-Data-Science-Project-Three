# Applied-Data-Science-Project-Three

We have three T-shirts--Plain Black Shirt, Code Shirt, and Graphic Shirt. The Plain Black Shirt is $100 with 25% discount. The Code Shirt is $75. The Graphic Shirt is $50. You have $75 in balance to buy the T-shirt. You can buy any T-shirt. But the balance is only sufficent for you to buy one T-shirt. If you already buy one and want to buy another. The website will pop up "Insufficient funds to buy this item.". The Plain Black Shirt has no figures or anything on it. But the sales button is in red and it has a sale. We design this experiment to see if red color and sales affect use click rates. The Plain Black Shirt and Code Shirt have same prices. But different marketing strategies. Graphic Shirt is cheaper and is used to become a comparison.  
You can also Rate the Super Graphic Store and leave comments.
