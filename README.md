# Applied-Data-Science-Project-Three

We have a black T-shirt. To know if red color has sales effect, we made two websites. One is regular website with a black T-shirt of $75. You can choose buy or not buy. Another website is the same black T-shirt. But this one has a red button of buy with $100 and 25% discount. So same price but different marketing strategics. Samely you can choose buy or not buy. 
And the clicking rate is recorded. In this experiment, we are going to compare different click rate for different websites.
