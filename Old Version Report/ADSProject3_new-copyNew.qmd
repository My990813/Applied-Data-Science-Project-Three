-   **Introduction & Research Question**

    In this project, we are designing and conducting an A/B Test experiment. A/B Test plays an important role in data science, especially for decision-making and user experience optimization. The idea behind A/B Testing is you have two group–A and B, and Group A is the original version and Group B is the modified version. You are comparing how each group behaves. By comparing the outcome for Group A and Group B, you will find out which one is better for you to use.

    Research question: Does red color for sales affect people's choice of buying clothes?

    Motivations: In a world filled with countless choices, marketing strategies—such as those used during major sales events like Black Friday—are crafted to influence consumer decisions. It is interesting to see the consistent use of the color red in advertisements across different countries. This widespread practice raises a compelling question: does the color red actually increase urgency in consumer behavior, encouraging quicker or more impulsive purchases?

-   **Experimental Design & Methodology**

    We have two websites–Website A and Website B. On the website, we have three T-shirts--Plain Black Shirt, Code Shirt, and Graphic Shirt. The Plain Black Shirt is \$100 with 25% discount. The Code Shirt is \$75. The Graphic Shirt is \$50. You have \$75 in balance to buy the T-shirt. You can buy any T-shirt. But the balance is only sufficent for you to buy one T-shirt. If you already buy one and want to buy another. The website will pop up "Insufficient funds to buy this item". The Plain Black Shirt has no figures or anything on it. But the sales button is in red and it has a sale for website A, but in color similar to other items for website B to see if red color and sales affect user click rates. The Plain Black Shirt and Code Shirt have same prices of \$75, but the code shirt doesn't use sale strategy and simply state the final price. Graphic Shirt is cheaper at \$50 and is used to be a comparison. You can also Rate the Super Graphic Store or leave comments.

    Difference between website A and website B: Website A uses red to highlight the sale item—a plain black shirt—while other items, such as the coded shirt and graphic shirt, are shown in mint green. On the other hand, Website B uses mint green for the sale item, matching the color used for the other items in the store.

Cookie-Based Assignment URL for A/B Testing: We created an index.html page on GitHub to serve as a redirect link that randomly sends users—with a 50% probability—to either Website A or Website B. The assigned group is stored in a cookie for 30 days to ensure consistent redirection on future visits.

-   **Data Collection**

    We sent the two website randomly to two stats students groups and our classmates. In total, 69 students entered Website A and 57 students entered Website B. They clicked on the website and left us valuable data.

    We analyzed the data via Google Analytics. In Google Analytics–View user engagement & retention tab, we are able to download the datasets for different events such as different kinds of purchase on three T-shirts. In User Explorer, we are able to download the datasets for individual users behaviors.

-   **Statistical Analysis & Results**

    After collecting the data, we first conducted a basic visualization of the click-through rate on the purchase button.\

From the visualization, we can observe that there is no clear difference in click rates between the two groups. To explore this further, we conducted a t-test.\

![t-test result](data_ana_pj3_files/t_test_result.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\

Based on the t-test result, the difference remains statistically insignificant. We then performed a chi-square test, which is commonly used to evaluate categorical outcomes between groups.\

![Chi-square result](data_ana_pj3_files/chi_square.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\

However, the chi-square test also yielded a non-significant result. We suspect that this may be due to the small sample size, which can affect the accuracy of the approximation.

To mitigate this, we additionally performed a Fisher's Exact Test, which is known to be more reliable for small sample sizes. Unfortunately, the Fisher test result was still not significant.

Since we cannot see clear statistical significance from the previous test, We want to further explore the relationship between user behaviors and the click-through on the black sale button, we trained a classification model using XGBoost.This model is to predict whether a user clicked the black button based on behavioral metrics collected from Google Analytics.

We selected key numerical features along with the experimental group variable, which was encoded as a binary indicator. The result is shown below:\
![XGBoost result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
From the result, we can tell the Average session duration, User engagement, and the Click Number are the top three most important factors. However, the group variable (groupA) has relatively low importance in the model, which is consistent with our earlier statistical tests (t-test, chi-square, and fisher test) showing no significant difference in click rates between Group A and Group B.\

To further interpret our XGBoost model, we generated Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to investigate one of the most important factors- click_number affects the likelihood of a user clicking the buy button.\
![PDP 1 result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
To explore interaction effects between click_number and group assignment, we also generated a 2D PDP plot: ![PDP 2 result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-2.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
The interaction plot shows that for both groups A and B, the predicted probability of purchase remains consistently low regardless of click_number. This pattern confirms that, while click_number plays a role in model prediction individually, its interaction with the group assignment does not lead to significant changes.The group is neither direly related to the clicking sale button, nor does it related to the click number.\

we applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to evaluate the contribution of each feature to the prediction of whether a user clicked the purchase button.

We first generated a local SHAP explanation for a single user:\
![shap 1 result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
This specific user had high user engagement and session counts, which contributed positively toward the predicted probability of clicking the button.

Then, we used the Feature Imp method to compute a global SHAP-like feature importance across all users:\
![shap 2 result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
From this result, we can tell that User engagement and Average session duration are the most important features globally for the model, and the group difference has no contribution towards the clicks for the sale button.\

we visualized the distribution of SHAP values for each feature using violin plots to further explore the feature-level differences between group A and group B. As shown below, certain variables such as click_number, User.engagement, and Engaged.sessions demonstrated noticeable divergence in SHAP contributions between the two groups.\
![shap last result](data_ana_pj3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}\
For instance, click_number appears to have a wider SHAP range in group B, which means this feature plays a more substantial role in driving prediction shifts for group B. On the other hand, features like Exits and Entrances exhibit nearly flat SHAP distributions for both groups.

-   **Interpretation & Conclusion**

In conclusion, the group difference—namely the use of a red color for the sales button—does not appear to have a statistically significant impact on users' tendency to click the purchase button. Instead, features such as average session duration, user engagement, and click number show stronger predictive power in influencing user behavior.

However, slight variations in SHAP values for user engagement and click number between the two groups suggest that the red color might still have a subtle effect on user interaction. This implies that while the red button alone is not a dominant factor, it may contribute marginally to the overall clicking behavior.\

-   **Challenges & Limitations**

```         
-   Google Analytics data take longer time to update at around 24-48 hours, so we need to wait until we get the data we want.

-   The file google-analytics.html was first designed with a tag event_name "purchase_click" for all shirt items, with different event_label 'Plain Black Shirt (Sale)', 'Code Shirt', and 'Graphic Shirt'. However, we later realized that it was difficult to retreived the data for event_label separately, so we change to incorporate all details in event_name which are 'purchase_click_plain_black_shirt_sale,' 'purchase_click_code_shirt' and 'purchase_click_graphic_shirt'.

-   The cookie-based assignment did not work properly, as a different version of the website would sometimes appear on subsequent clicks, so we added a small delay (100ms) to ensure the cookie is saved before the page redirects.
